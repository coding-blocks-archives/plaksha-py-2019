1. Find the length of a string using loops (not len()).
2. Write a program that accepts two strings and outputs the concatenation of them.

      Example: ‘hello’ , ‘world’ ==> ‘helloworld’

3. Write a program that accepts a sentence (string) and calculate the number of letters and digits. Example: ‘this is a test sentence number 389’ ==> letters = 25 and digits = 3.
4. Write a program that accepts a string and outputs the string with all capital letters.

      Example: ‘hello’ ==> ‘HELLO’

5. Write a program that accepts a sentence and calculate the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.
6. Swap cases in a string using loops.
7. Write  a program that counts the occurrence of a character in a string. Example: ‘This is a test string.’ count of i = 3.
8. Write a program to find if a given string is a pallindrome or not.
9. Write a program to that accepts a string s, an index number n and a character ‘c’. And outputs the string replaced with the character at the index number n. Example- ‘hello’ , 0 , ‘j’ ==> ‘jello’
10. Output the integer number indicating the total number of occurrences of the substring in the original string.
11. Check if there are K consecutive 1’s in a binary number. Example: ’100100111011110010111’ 
    ```
    k = 3 output: True
    k = 5 output: False
    ```
12. Reverse a string.
13. Find the only one non repeated number in a string (rest all have pairs). Example: ‘abcccdbfhdifih’ => has only 1 non pair c.
14. Write a program which accepts two strings s1 and s2 and checks if s2 is a substring of s1.
15. Make a password validator with the following checks. A website requires the users to input username and password to register. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
    Following are the criteria for checking the password:

     1. At least 1 letter between [a-z]
     2. At least 1 number between [0-9]
     3. At least 1 letter between [A-Z]
     4. At least 1 character from [$#@]
     5. Minimum length of transaction password: 6
     6. Maximum length of transaction password: 12
     Your program should accept a sequence of comma separated passwords and will check them according to the above criteria. Passwords that match the criteria are to be printed, each separated by a comma.
     Example
     If the following passwords are given as input to the program:
     ABd1234@1,a F1#,2w3E*,2We3345
     Then, the output of the program should be:
     ABd1234@1
